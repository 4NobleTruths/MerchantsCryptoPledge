Merchants' Cryptocurrency Pledge Introduction
=============================================

Let's not fool ourselves: at the time of this writing in August 2014, most merchants who say they "accept Bitcoin" and/or other cryptocurrencies, are really doing no such thing.

What they do, is use the services of yet another middleman, called a payment processor, who accepts cryptocurrency on the merchants's behalf, converts it immediately into fiat currency, and sends it to the merchants' fiat bank account.

The positive and negative effects of that for all involved are multi-faceted, complex, and endlessly debatable.

What is not debatable, is that merchants who use such automatic conversion to fiat, in reality accept fiat for their goods and services, rather than cryptocurrency.

This git repository is for merchants who wish to collaborate on developing a voluntary pledge, which we can then post on our websites and places of business.

This document is intended to identify those of us who are committed to building commerce without the use of fiat currency, as much as the ambient business and legal conditions allow.
